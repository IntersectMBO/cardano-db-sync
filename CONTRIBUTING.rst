***********************************************

The ``cardano-db-sync`` development is primarily based on the Nix infrastructure (https://nixos.org/ ), which enables packaging, CI, development environments and deployments.

On how to set up Nix for ``cardano-db-sync`` development, please see `Building Cardano Node with nix <https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/tree/master/doc/getting-started/building-the-node-using-nix.md>`_.

We maintain a [CODEOWNERS file][CODEOWNERS] which provides information who

from all code owners (even though GitHub doesn't give a way to enforce it).
