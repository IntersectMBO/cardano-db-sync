# Revision history for cardano-db-sync

## 13.4.0.0

* Added `tx.treasury_donation`

## 13.3.0.0
* Support for Conway (see schema docs)
* Fixed epoch_param missing for the first Shelley era [#1715]
* Moved command line options that filter data to the config file
* Added epoch_state table
* Added an optional feature to store CBOR serialized transactions in `tx_cbor` table [#1723]
* Added an optional feature to store pool stats per epoch transactions in `pool_stat` table
* EnableFutureGenesis is now true by default

## 13.2.0.2
* Support node 8.9.x
* Add a new db-sync config field `EnableFutureGenesis`. When false or missing, the conway genesis file is ignored

## 13.2.0.1
* Added a new table `epoch_stake_progress` which indicates when `epoch_stake` is completed
* Uses the cache for the computation of `epoch` table when following
* `epoch_stake` is now computed earlier, before the epoch is reached
* Exception handling and concurrency improved.
* When `--disable-ledger` is used, db-sync won't populate the `tx.deposit` field as it's too expensive
* Support for Conway (see schema docs)
* Added a `--bootstrap-tx-out` flag. Read more at `doc/configuration.md`.
* When `--consumed-tx-out` is enabled, db-sync won't populate the `tx_in` table
* Added flags `--force-tx-in` which bypasses the default behaviour mentioned above
* Migrations from consume to prune are now much faster
* References to `offline` for pool metadata are replaced by `offchain`
* Added a new table `extra_migrations`
* DBSync no longer does any query to the `tx_out` table during syncing
* Added flags `--disable-in-out`, `--disable-shelley`, `--disable-gov`, `--only-gov`, `--keep-tx-metadata`
* Move MIR from reward to instant_reward. Done with a migration.
* Remove redundant field `address_raw` of `tx_out` and `collateral_tx_out`
* Partial Conway integration. You can read more in `doc/schema.md` (tagged as Conway). Also in files
`schema/cardano-chain-gen/schema/migration-2-0032-20230815.sql` and `schema/cardano-chain-gen/schema/migration-2-0032-20230815.sql`
for the raw sql migrations.
* Removed `reward.id` field. `instant_reward` table also doesn't have an id field.

## 13.1.1.3
* Adds compatibility with node-8.0.0 [#1403] and node-8.1.1 [#1455]
* Adds compatibility with the new format of the CostModel in Alonzo genesis file [#1403]

* Provided experimental options which turn off parts of the schema [#1379]
* Fixed an issue where `epoch` table didn't rollback [#1370]
* Fixed an issue with smash returning `InvalidUrlException` [#1353]
* Takes less snapshots, since big rollbacks are now faster
* When `--disable-ledger` is enabled a `--state-dir` is no longer required
* Added experimental extra migrations, controlled by `consumed-tx-out` and `prune-tx-out`
