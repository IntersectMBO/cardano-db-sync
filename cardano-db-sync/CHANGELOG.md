# Revision history for cardano-db-sync

## Sancho changelog
`sancho-a-b-c` tags in db-sync are a series of incremental integration of conway feautures. These tags can follow the
sanchonet https://book.world.dev.cardano.org/environments.html#sanchonet-testnet.
Their enumeration has the following meaning:<br>
a: schema changes<br>
b: compatible with a respinned sanchonet or node<br>
c: minor changes or fixes<br>

It is advised to resync from genesis when using a new version a or b.

Some useful links (adjust the numbers to the correct tag):

- Schema docs https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/blob/sancho-2-0-0/doc/schema.md
- Postgres migrations https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/tree/sancho-2-0-0/schema

In the schema docs, you can search for `13.2` or `Conway` for schema changes from the previous official release.

- `governance_action.ratified_epoch` is now populated
- `drep_distr.active_until` is now populated

### sancho-1.0.0
The schema is quite close to the [initial design](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/blob/conway-schema-design-13.2/doc/schema.md). You may find some differences: ie the `param_proposals` and `epoch_param` are not extended yet,
Some tables/fields are created but are not populated yet: `anchor_offline_data`, `anchor_offline_fetch_error` , `drep_distr` , `governance_action.x_epoch` , `delegation_vote.redeemer_id`

### sancho-0.0.0
It's very early stage and is missing all Conway specific feautures and some Shelley features related to Rewards. Incremental tags will follow.

## 13.2.0.0 - Unreleased
* Uses the cache for the computation of `epoch` table when following
* `epoch_stake` is now computed earlier, before the epoch is reached
